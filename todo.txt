reject: add a .wget local command to access web-pages
done: a www_get(url='') function to have AI download web pages from internet.
      In both of these the html download is with javascript off, this is nearly worthless...
      I have heard of a new special library that is built to download webpages llms  is has fire in its name)
Done: Make a functions and routines executable from both sides.  (Allowing for local side exec and ask_user ect)
Todo: Add routine to update OpenAI_API_Costs.py


Todo: The file create_new_process.py, creates the example process structure.
      But the code in the prompts needs to be updated by hand.
      A command "Make Default" is required that saves the structure and contents of a proces,
      To be used in future '-create' command.  This will simplify development.

Todo: need a repository for example processes

Todo: Write macro values to a file, so that they will be reloaded.
Todo: .macros line to insert new values into macros.

Todo: Have problem with macro replacement.
      Macros are substituted during building of message list.
      The creation of the step is done after building of messages.
      The .LLM statement is part of building messages so macros substitution is too early
      The Macros should be executed at last minute.
      This will allow values to be prepared before they are substituted.
      It also matches user expectancy

Todo: Documentation for macros
